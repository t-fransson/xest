# Introduction

Discussed here is the analysis of our protocol for (rapid) analysis of XES data. Can be generalized to other spectroscopies as well.

Lots already discussed in {cite}`xesdiag2018`.

## Experimental protocol

Below is the simultaneous XES/XRD protocol often used. Maybe use new figures - clearer and without copyright.

Simultaneous XES and XRD.

## XES

MO diagrams?

## Spectrometer

Figure on von Hamos

## Include PS II analysis?

- Biochem2

- Background subtraction differences (and impact on first moments, comparisons to other groups)

- Maybe population analysis
