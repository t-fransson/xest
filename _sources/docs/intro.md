# Introduction
Discussed here is the analysis of our protocol for (rapid) analysis of XES data. Can be generalized to other spectroscopies as well. Lots already discussed in {cite}`xesdiag2018`.


## Experimental protocol
Below is the simultaneous XES/XRD protocol often used. Maybe use new figures - clearer and without copyright.

Simultaneous XES and XRD.

## XES

MO diagrams?

## Spectrometer

Figure on von Hamos

## Include PS II analysis?

- Biochem2

- Background subtraction differences (and impact on first moments, comparisons to other groups)

- Maybe population analysis

```{note}
Margaret: Under 'PSII Analysis' in introduction, I wonder if in addition to linking to PSII article, we could include a very brief overview of PSII, Kok Cycle, expected oxidation state changes with flash etc. just to prime somebody who has very little background of our example system, so they know what a flash state is,....even though the toolbox can be generalized to any sample
```

```{note}
I wonder if under references, we could include an 'additional resources' section in which we link to articles for more detail about XES or Von Hamos detectors, etc.
