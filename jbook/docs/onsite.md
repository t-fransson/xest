# On-site analysis

Typical protocols and scripts to run on-site.

- Task: Projection of signal, compare beamtimes
	- img
	- spatial proj (shot-normalized)
	- energy proj (shot-normalized)
- Task: project and construct spectrum
	- hit sorting
	- img
	- spat proj
	- energy proj (calibrated)
- Tracking properties
    - first moment etc
- Checking for other issues (typically detector-related)
    - multi-hits
    - dead/too active pixels
    - inconsistent gain
    - ...

```{note}
Margaret: Under 'on-site analysis', could mention significance/explanation of darks/pedestals. I wonder if it would eventually be worthwhile to include the code Clemens has for processing our own pedestals in case the accelerator folks don't get to it...
