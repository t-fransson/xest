# Descriptors

A variety of commonly used parameters exist for fast, quantitative and qualitative analysis of your spectra. 

## Difference spectra

First, one may study the evolution of a sample by subtracting it from a reference. This is one of the more straightforward techniques and can simplify the search for spectral changes. 

## First moment

This parameter may be used to track changes in the center-of-mass. The first moment is such a nice descriptor, especially for very dilute system or a system with low signal, as statistics are computed over the entire spectra. As a result, it will be much less sensitive to noise compared to other parameters. 

## FWHM

The full width at half maximum is computed from the energy values at 50% of the signal's peak intensity. 

## IAD

The final parameter is collected by integrating over the absolute value of a difference spectrum. 

## Error bar estimation
